# C++ 
[!Note] Current Version of C++ is C++23

C++ is very fast computer language, usually used in embedded system or computer graphic.

In this tutorial will let you know to write C++ file with example code.


# Structure of C++ program
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout << "Hello World";
    return 0;
}
```

1. `#include <iostream>` is preprocessor or header of the program.

2. `main()` is the the method that will be executed on the screen.

3. `std::cout << "Hello World;"` is the first basically output syntax, and you will see "Hello World" when program is run after compiled.

4. `return 0;` will return the value of main function.
